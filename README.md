__A small program which can list contents of directories and subdirectories, without a depth limit!__ Right now there are a few bugs so I do not recommend using this as a package for use in other projects. Due to my low knowledge of PyPi, you only get files from the installation folder. If you really want to use this, run it in the command line with: `python -m listevery [folder]`. Yes, you will get the files and folders where the package is installed. It is formatted similar to this:
```
Folders   Files
[folder1] [file1.txt, file2.py]
[] [thing.mp4]
```
If you want to run this in a Python script, check out the test.py file included in the downloads! Sorry if you get horribly handled errors, I still need to fix that.

## New updates
```
  - Some small bug fixes. You can run it from a Python file now!
